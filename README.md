# Brain Tumor Classification

This repository contains the code and resources for my final year project as a computer engineering student at Olabisi Onabanjo University. The project focuses on a comparative analysis of different CNN architectures for the classification of brain tumors using deep learning techniques. The goal of the project is to compare the performance of InceptionV3, ResNet50, and VGG architectures in classifying brain tumor images, aiding in the diagnosis and treatment of brain tumors.

## Project Details
- **Project Title:** Brain Tumor Classification
- **Student Name:** Onafuye Oluwapelumi Peter
- **Matric Number:** EES/18/19/0460
- **University:** Olabisi Onabanjo University

## Project Description
The project involves a comparative analysis of InceptionV3, ResNet50, VGG, Inception-Resnet and EfficientNet architectures for the classification of brain tumor images. Each architecture is trained on a dataset of brain tumor images, and their performance is evaluated based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. The repository contains the code for data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and inference for each architecture.
